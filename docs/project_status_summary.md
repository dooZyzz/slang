# SwiftLang Project Status Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Reorganization ✅
Successfully reorganized the entire codebase into a cleaner, more logical directory structure:

- **Runtime Organization**: Split runtime into logical subdirectories:
  - `core/` - Core VM and execution engine
  - `modules/` - Module system with subfolders for loader, formats, extensions, lifecycle
  - `packages/` - Package management system
  
- **Build System Updates**: 
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt to reflect new structure
  - Fixed all include paths throughout the codebase
  - All 116 tests continue to pass

### 2. Critical TODO Resolutions ✅

#### High Priority (Completed)
1. **Module Format Checksum Verification**
   - Fixed checksum calculation that was temporarily disabled
   - Proper file position handling during verification
   - Added error handling for edge cases

2. **Module Unloading with Reference Checking**
   - Added thread-safe reference counting to Module structure
   - Implemented module_ref(), module_unref(), and module_get_ref_count()
   - Fixed module_loader_unload_all() to properly iterate and unload
   - Modules are automatically reference counted when loaded

3. **Module Lifecycle Management**
   - Complete lifecycle tracking from loading to unloading
   - Proper resource cleanup including native handles
   - Thread-safe operations throughout

#### Medium Priority (Completed)
1. **Proper LRU Cache Eviction**
   - Added last_access_time tracking to modules
   - Implemented sorting by access time for eviction
   - Only evicts modules with zero references
   - Prevents memory leaks with proper cleanup

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed memory leaks by implementing ast_free_program() calls
- Replaced TODO placeholders with actual implementations
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Improved thread safety with proper mutex usage

## Current State

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 116
- **Passing**: 116 (100%)
- **Failing**: 0
- **Performance**: ~28ms total runtime

### Remaining TODOs
- **Total**: 34 (down from 38)
- **Completed**: 4 high/medium priority items
- **Categories**: Module system, package system, language features, tools, native modules

### Build Status
- Builds successfully on macOS
- Minor warnings (mostly unused parameters and GNU extensions)
- All critical functionality working

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### High Priority
1. Complete remaining module system TODOs
2. Enhance error handling and recovery
3. Improve documentation

### Medium Priority  
1. Bundle metadata JSON parsing
2. Module dependency resolution improvements
3. Native module enhancements

### Low Priority
1. Tool improvements
2. Additional language features
3. Performance optimizations

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- ✅ Robust module system with proper lifecycle management
- ✅ Memory leak fixes and improved resource management
- ✅ Thread-safe caching with LRU eviction
- ✅ All tests passing with improved implementations
